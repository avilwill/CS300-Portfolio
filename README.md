# CS300-Portfolio
Portfolio for Course CS-300 SNHU Computer Science

### Files uploaded information/description
ProjectOne: provides pseudocode for three milestones, focusing on vectors, hash tables, binary search trees; A reflection covering runtime analysis for the milestones, and which I would do my project on. 

CourseFP): This is the final code for a program that loads, displays, and finds courses along with their prerequisites. The project was successfully implemented using the Hash table Milestone, which is my most accomplished work from CS300

#### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
One problem I ran into with most assignments was compiling my C++ code. C++ is pretty new to me when I need to run a program. I was also new to nodes, so it was a little challenging.

#### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I went back and read the instructions on using Eclipse, went through the Eclipse tutorial, and followed the steps to build the project to create an executable file. I was then able to run a local application and compile my code. Understanding data structures helped me learn how the nodes work, solving my other problem. A node is a building block used to create dynamic data structures; This is importatn for making structures that can grow or shrink in the run time. 
#### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I used notes from Zybook lessons, which included numerous examples and interactive problems to help understand definitions and their application in our final program. Zybooks also provided pseudocode and resources for further research for project one. Anything I wanted to expand on futher than what Zybook information offered, I just did a google search and found good information from other developers who have had similair issues or solutions.  
#### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
My design and development process heavily relies on pseudocode. In the past, I often jumped into coding too quickly, trying to think through every detail. Now, I prioritize writing everything out in pseudocode before diving into the actual coding.
#### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Understanding data structures and their impact on runtime is crucial for writing efficient programs. Properly chosen structures—like hashes, trees, or vectors—enhance maintainability, readability, and adaptability, leading to faster code that remains simple and organized.
